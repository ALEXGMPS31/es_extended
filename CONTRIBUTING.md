## What should I know before I get started?

### Esx v2 and module

Esx v2 is a replacment for the deprecated Esx v1 FiveM resource. The version 2 is looking for something modular and optimized. **If you're not familiar with the concept of modules/components, you can look at the [Official Documentation | Modules](https://wiki.esx-framework.org/es_extended2/modules/)**
