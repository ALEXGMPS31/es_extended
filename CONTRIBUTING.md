## What should I know before I get started?

### Esxv2 and module

Esxv2 is a replacment for the deprecated Esxv1 FiveM resource. The version 2 is looking for something modular and optimized. **If you're not familiar with the concept of modules/components, you can look at the [Official Documentation | Modules](https://wiki.esx-framework.org/es_extended2/modules/)**

## How Can I Contribute?

You can contribute to the Esx projects by many ways, here is a non exhaustive list of what a contributor usually do.

### Reporting Bugs

A bug is something that should be working, but it doesn't.
Reporting bugs seems easy, but keep in mind you'll have to provide at least the reproduction steps or even a reproduction case, it make everyone's life easier when details are accurate. You can use the GitHub issue template to guide you.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancements is taking something existing and improve it in many different ways. Explain why you propose such an enhancement and what it involve. Does it causes a breaking change ? Again, please use the GitHub issue template.

### Your First Code Contribution

If you want to start helping us with code, you can start by browse the issues and see if a label `Easy Pick` is in it. If so, it means that the problem solve shouldn't be a huge effort.

### Pull Requests

When you start to contribute, we recommand you to create a new branch from `<fork>/develop` and then make a pull request either to track the feature or to request a code review. After the code review, we'll merge the changes into the develop branch of the official repository.

## Style Guidelines

We are not really strict on this one, but good readability and naming matters a lot.
We do not ask you to use these styleguides, but rather to encourage such styles.

### Git Commit Messages

We are mostly using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/).
